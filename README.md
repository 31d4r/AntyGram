# AntyGram


<p>Hello readers! Hola a todos! Depends of the language area you are coming from. This is a small demonstration of an app called AntyGram (I got this app for testing practical skills). Also with this app I am going to show you my skills (currently) in the iOS development field.Working with HTTPS requests, making realtime post app and etc. Plase be patient and don't take things so serius, all of us are starting from the beginning.</p>
<p>Uhh.. for the backend I was using Google Firebase.</p>
<h4>1. Log in screen</h4>

<p>Down below you are able to see how login screen looks like. You have two fileds : username (email) and password filed. As regullary you have standrrd "SIGN IN" button I have added two more (to be attractive lol): Facebook and Google button.</p>

<br>

<p>I made some changes to the login screen, added some verifications such as:</p>
<p>1. You will receive an error if you haven't typed anything into fields</p>
<p>2. You will receive an error if you made mistake during entering password</p>
<p>3. You will receive an error if you have typed wrong email</p>
<br>
<p>These screens down below shows you how it looks like.</p>

<h4>2. Register screen</h4>

<p>Same as the login screen, you have bunch of standard fields with added images to the left side of the filed. Also it has a verficiation such as:</p>
<p>1. You will receive an error if your password has less than 6 characters</p>
<p>2. You will receive an error if you made mistake during entering password (password is not the same)</p>
<p>3. You will receive an error if you have typed wrong email</p>
<br>
<p>These screens down below shows you how it looks like.</p>

<h4>3. Feed</h4>
<p>It looks as normal feed as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter has. More less...but it looks nice.</p>

<br>
<p>As all social media network has something special, I have the same one. Nothing more than normal feed. Lol this was so stupid. Don't worry images are hardcoded. There are some features as:</p>
<p>1. Of course you are able to wirte a post (it would be stupid if I wrote: post a post? Oh english grammar).</p>
<p>2. Time is working, since the 0 seconds ago back to 1970. So it means, it works totally fine.</p>
<p>3. You are able to scroll the posts until you get bored.</p>
<p>4. And now one of the most important buttons, "SIGN OUT". I know iti s hard to press this button on Facebook, Instagram etc. but on this app hah just a second and you are gone. To the hell. How an app looks like you will be able to see down below.</p>

<p>At the end I know that an app is now something wow but for my skills now, it is really nice. Thanks for reading this post. Next time I will be smarter :) </p>
