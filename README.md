<p>I made some changes to the login screen, added some verifications such as:</p>
1. You will receive an error if you haven't typed anything into fields
2. You will receive an error if you made mistake during entering password
3. You will receive an error if you have typed wrong email</p>
<br>
<p>These screens down below shows you how it looks like.</p>
